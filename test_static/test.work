Q objectives readmission has a major role in the reduction of the quality of life and the increase in the years of lost life the main objectives of this study were to answer to the following research questions a what was the readmission rate b what were the social demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the psychiatric emergency service at nour university hospital affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences isfahan iran c what were the effective factors on readmission method this cross sectional study was conducted on a total number of 3935 patients who were admitted to isfahan university hospital psychiatric ward in isfahan iran from 2004 to 2010 gender age marital status education self report history of previous admission type of psychiatric disorder substance misuse suicide and the length of the current psychiatric disorder were collected from the registered medical files of patients the data were analysed using the negative binomial regression model results we found that factors such as psychiatric anxiety disorder bipolar i bipolar ii psychotic disorder depression and self report history of previous admission were statistically significant in the number of readmissions using the negative binomial model conclusion readmission to the psychiatric ward is mainly predictable by the type of diagnosis and psychosocial supports
Q aim the updated mean hba1c has been used in risk estimates of diabetic complications but it does not take into account the temporal relationship between hba1c and diabetic complications we studied whether the updated mean hba1c underestimated the risk of diabetic complications method continuous hba1c curves for 10 000 hypothetical diabetes patients were simulated over an average of 7 years simulations were based on hba1c values encountered in clinical practice we assumed that each short time interval of the continuous hba1c curves had a long lasting effect on diabetic complications as evidenced by earlier studies we tested several different hba1c variables including various profiles e g different duration of such a long lasting effect the predictive power of these variables was compared with that of the updated mean hba1c results the predictive power of the constructed hba1c variables differed considerably compared to that of the updated mean hba1c the risk increase per standard deviation could be almost 100 higher for a constructed predictor than the updated mean hba1c conclusions the importance of good glycemic control in preventing diabetic complications could have been underestimated in earlier hallmark studies by not taking the time dependent effect of hba1c into account
